This repository is intended to house explorative resources and code for my Epicodus capstone project, the working title of which is 'Light Patch.'

# Learning objectives for capstone project
* Event-driven programming with ruby
* Real-time API with Rails
* IoT technologies

# Post-Epicodus Plan
After Epicodus I have specific goals to keep myself motivated and productive in my job hunt, and beyond that I'm setting longer-term goals for continued learning and advancement once I've found a job. My immediate goals mostly involve polishing my favorite projects from my time in bootcamp and my presentation of these projects to potential employers. In addition to this polishing process, I intend to write 2-3 blog posts about some of these projects to highlight my process and the technologies used. After I find that first job, my biggest tangible goal is to learn React. More general goals at that point include strengthening my understanding of computer science fundamentals and exploring more advanced concepts with JavaScript. Some specific steps to achieve these goals:

...to complete before internship:
* Polish 'GlamaJSON' drag race API and get it hosted with working token authentication.
* Deploy top 4 projects from Epicodus.
* Finish building portfolio site.
* Implement music-responsiveness on capstone project.
* Write blog post about capstone project.

...goals during internship:
* Learn React via building an app which uses my drag race API to do data analysis
* Continue work on hardware aspects of capstone project.
* Attend 1-2 meetups of interest every week.
* Revisit music visualizer project, get working with Soundcloud API
* Apply for 2-3 jobs every day.

...exploration after internship:
* Complete Rithm School online courses for: Terminal and UNIX, Advanced JavaScript and Data Structures and Algorithms
* Master big O notation
* Finish watching Harvard CS50 lectures
* Learn more about IoTs tools and applications


...longer-term goals:
* Learn more about circuit design and hardware for continued exploration of IoT applications of web technologies
* Explore VR/AR technologies
* Give a talk on capstone project at a meetup
* Learn how to build native mobile apps
* Continue exploring arts applications of programming
* Become the fiercest software engineer around üíÅüèº
